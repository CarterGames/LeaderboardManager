> Version 2.0.1

## Key Features

## How To Install
Either download and import the package from the releases section or the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/leaderboard-manager-cg-177291">Unity Asset Store</a> and use the package manager. Alternatively, download this repo and copy all files into your project. 

## Setup & Basic Usage
The asset doesnâ€™t need any setup by you to function. By default there are no leaderboards in the save. The save will automatically create itself when you first create a leaderboard with the system. The leaderboard save goes to the users computer <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html">persistent datapath</a>, under the `/Leaderboard` directory.

### Create a leaderboard called "MyBoard"
> LeaderboardManager.CreateLeaderboard("MyBoard");

### Get leaderboard data for the board called "MyBoard"
> var _data = LeaderboardManager.GetLeaderboard("MyBoard");

### Add entry to board called "MyBoard" for a player called "John" with a score of 100
> LeaderboardManager.AddEntryToBoard("MyBoard", new LeaderboardEntry("John", 100));
> LeaderboardManager.AddEntryToBoard("MyBoard", "John", 100);

### Remove entry from board called "MyBoard" for a player called "John" of a score of 100
> LeaderboardManager.DeleteEntryFromBoard("MyBoard", new LeaderboardEntry("John", 100));
> LeaderboardManager.DeleteEntryFromBoard("MyBoard", "John", 100);

### Save all leaderboards
> LeaderboardManager.Save();

### Load all leaderboards
> LeaderboardManager.Load();

## Limitations
For technical reasons, the asset doesn't support WebGL game builds at present. This system is also local ONLY.
